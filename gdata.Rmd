This project is to visualize my personal location data as seen by google.

Originalyl I did this project in Python using Bokeh.

```{r}
 library("jsonlite", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.6")
 library("dplyr",lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.6")
 library("purrr",lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.6")     

```



```{r}
 js <- jsonlite::fromJSON("./gdata.json")

```

```{r}
js

```


```{r}

describe(js)

```

```{r}
str(js)
```
