This project is to visualize my personal location data as seen by google.

Originalyl I did this project in Python using 

```{r}
 library("jsonlite", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.6")
 library("dplyr",lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.6")

```



```{r}
 js <- jsonlite::fromJSON("./gdata.json",simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)
```


```{r}
df = jsonlite:: flatten(js, recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r}
str(js)
```
